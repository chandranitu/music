##. write a python code for permutation combination of character and save generated chars in different file.

Ex- have a character array
     arr=['a','b','c']

  total per & comm of arr-  abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba (6 ways)
   
under test folder - abc.txt (content under file is a b c)
                    acb.txt (content under file is a c b) etc

##. write a python code for permutation combination of sound file  and save generated sounds in different file.
     
         Ex- a- bird.wav file
             b- dog.wav file
             c- cow.wav file

 total per & comm of arr-  abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba (6 ways)
   
under test folder - abc.wav (content under file is sound of a b c in sequence)
                    acb.wav (content under file is sound of a c b in sequence) etc


# Rules for running permutation and combination

# wave file mapping with generated text

# mood based selection

# Daytime based selection

# Algorithm writing


##  Make a gui where all 12 beats are present and user can select beats out of 12. There must be readymade raag beats for user convenient
